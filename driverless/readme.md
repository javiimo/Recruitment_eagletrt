# Recruiting driverless

> ⚠️ This document is fairly technical to maintain brevity, if you have **any** questions ask your recruiter or come visit us at floor -2 of Povo 2.

## Abstract

The driverless teamwork is characterized by the need of a broad skillset and an attitude to solve unforseen problems with little to no guidance.
For this reason, the driverless recruitment process is built on top of the standard SW assignments, this means that you need to solve, according to the specified modalities, one of the many standard SW recruitment projects.
On top of that you have to complete two out of the 4 simple projects below, these are needed to attest the required basic skills or, alternatively, the ability to research and understand the problem at hand even if you have never worked on it before
Alternatively you can present one or multiple projects developed personally or in an academic context related to the general scope of driverless application, e.g. Image processing, Video processing, 3D data manipulation, Computer vision, Machine learning applied to CV problems etc.

From the project you chose, we will test your programming skills, your approach to a problem and your solving process.  
Remember that the choices you make must have a foundation, and based on that an easier solution may be preferred to a more complex one.

## Projects

Here you can find four folders:

- [project_1](./project_1/readme.md): Image processing.
